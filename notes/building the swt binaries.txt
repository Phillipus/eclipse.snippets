Building the SWT binaries
-------------------------

- See https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/discussions/1065#discussioncomment-8617014
- And https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/pull/973


TL;DR:

1. cd eclipse.platform.swt
2. mvn clean process-resources -pl org.eclipse.swt:org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.aarch64 -am -Dnative=cocoa.macosx.aarch64 -DskipTests



Note from that first post:

"A prerequisite for building the binaries is to have an swtBuildQualifier.txt in bundles\org.eclipse.swt\target,
which is created by simply running an ordinary Maven build on the complete SWT repository (or you can probably also create it manually).
Then you can execute the following within the folder of the fragment you want to build"


To build eclipse.platform.swt first:

1. cd eclipse.platform.swt
2. mvn clean generate-resources -Dnative=cocoa.macosx.aarch64 -DskipTests


To build the *.jnilib binaries for Mac aarch64:

1. cd eclipse.platform.swt/binaries/org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.aarch64
2. mvn clean process-resources -Dnative=cocoa.macosx.aarch64 -DskipTests

(For windows it would be -Dnative=win32.win32.x86_64)
